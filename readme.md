# AdVaper - Youtube Ad blocker for chromium based browsers
![Alt text](icon_512.png "AdVaper")

AdVaper is a plain and simple adblocker for youtube that works on chromium based browsers. It looks for changes in the DOM and it skips the loading of video ads when possible, by directly clicking on the skip button or by removing the ad container.

It is not a perfect youtube ad blocker, but it works the majority of the time. It is also very lightweight and it does not require any special permission. 

## How it works
AdVaper looks for changes in the DOM and it skips the loading of the ads when possible, by directly clicking on the skip button or by removing the ad container. 
It is limited to the youtube domain and it does not require any special permission. No data is collected or sent to any server.

## Performance and footprint
Footprint is minimal and it should not affect the performance of the browser, having said that, it is still in development and it might have some bugs.


## Installation
For the time being, the only way to install AdVaper is to download the source code and load it as an unpacked extension. Google and Microsoft are currently removing youtube ad blockers from their stores, so I will not publish it there.
